Encryption use has become easier in recent history, still more often than not, encrypted communication tools require activists to move their entire network of contacts onto using a platform or app that may not have been designed for the context in which they operate. Often these are western tools with no historical trust, and sometimes the simple presence of encrypted traffic or traffic from known encryption applications may be enough of a red flag to draw attention to activists. We propose a system that uses research algorithms to encode messages into different human-readable text. This new text can be shared freely on any platform that is used by the activists, blends into network traffic, and can still be decoded by trusted partners.
